# Rnn_GoogleStockPricePrediction

### created a Deep Learning model to study the performance of google stock price using RNN from where we get many insights about upwards or downwards trends. The model will be based on Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) because model is working on a time-series (stock price over time) and RNNs works well on time-series or in general sequence problems
